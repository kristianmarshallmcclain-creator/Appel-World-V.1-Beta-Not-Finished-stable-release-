# Appel-World-V.1-Beta-Not-Finished-stable-release-
Hello, I am KrisTV1 from Scratch, and I have finally after a whole year completed my Beta version of the appel world game. Took a lot of polish, bug fixes and using scripts from others, even though all the levels are not finished, it's still good. Please let me know in the project comment section or add anything studio.
The levels are NOT fully finished, and there is a bit of a bug I will fix soon, which is the spike bug, where when you step on a spike, it doesn't quickly make you lose.
